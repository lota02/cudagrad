Based on your current progress and the fact that you are working nights and weekends, I'll provide an estimated timeline for each milestone. Keep in mind that these estimates can vary depending on your personal learning pace, available time, and other factors. Adjust the timeline as needed to fit your schedule and progress.

1. Implement basic tensor data structure and functionality (Completed by April 5th)
2. Add support for arithmetic operations:
- [x] April 6 - April 12: Implement subtraction, multiplication, and division (both scalar and tensor-wise)
- [x] April 13 - April 19: Implement element-wise operations and broadcasting
3. Implement autograd functionality for simple operations:
- [x] April 20 - April 26: Implement the basic autograd system and support for addition and subtraction
- [ ] April 27 - May 3: Extend autograd support to multiplication, division, and element-wise operations
4. Add support for advanced tensor operations:
- [ ] May 4 - May 17: Implement functions such as reduction, indexing, sorting, and other advanced operations
5. Optimize performance and memory usage:
- [ ] May 18 - June 1: Profile the library, identify bottlenecks, and optimize the code for better performance and memory usage
6. Write comprehensive documentation and tutorials:
- [ ] June 2 - June 15: Write thorough documentation, examples, and tutorials to guide users in utilizing the library effectively

The timeline above suggests that you could potentially complete your tensor autograd project by mid-June 2023. Remember, this is just an estimate, and it's crucial to remain flexible and adjust your plan as needed. It's also essential to allocate time for debugging, testing, and unforeseen challenges that may arise during the development process. Good luck with your project!

# T.h

> "It was much easier when I first did STL I had one gigantical file called 'stl.h' -- but at that time people said: 'It's utterly unacceptable, you have 20,000 lines of code. People cannot have includes that large.' If you think about it now of days, it appears to be very funny. â€“ Alexander Stepanov (https://youtu.be/aIHAEYyoTUc&t=2002)

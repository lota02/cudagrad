# torchy ðŸ”¥

A small tensor-valued autograd engine, inspired by PyTorch and micrograd.

## Hello torchy

The main abstraction torchy provides is a `Tensor` class:

```c++
#include <iostream>

#include "torchy.h"

int main() {
  Tensor<int> t({1}, {42}); // Tensor of 1 element holding 42
  std::cout << t << std::endl; // [42]
}
```

The next example uses a C++ interpreter called [cling](https://github.com/root-project/cling):

```c++
[cling]$ #include "torchy.h"
[cling]$ Tensor<std::string> t({2,2}, {"one", "two", "three", "four"});
[cling]$ std::cout << t << std::endl; // Row-major order
[[one, two],
 [three, four]]
```

## Autograd

Passing `true` as the third parameter sets `requires_grad_` to `true` and allows a `Tensor` to start tracking the expression graph, and allows gradients to be set during back-propagation.

```c++
[cling]$ Tensor<float> a({1}, {42.0}, true);
[cling]$ float b = 2.0;
[cling]$ auto c = a + b;
[cling]$ c.backward()
[cling]$ c.graph()
Tensor@0x10594c770 (+)
  Tensor@0x60000160d198
  Tensor@0x60000160d318
[cling]$ c.storage_.get()->data_
(std::vector<float> &) { 44.0000f }
[cling]$ a.autograd_meta_.get()->grad_.storage_.get()->data_
(std::vector<float> &) { 1.00000f }
```

Setting `requires_grad_` to `true` is only allowed for `Tensor`s that are a C++ built-in floating point type (`float`, `double`, or `long double`).

## Design

The plan is to be similar to PyTorch's internals, particularily the [Variable/Tensor Merge Proposal](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/13638) design.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to learn more about PyTorch's internals, neural networks, and C++.

To do this, I'll gradually add support to torchy for the mathematical operations required to create the expression graph of various neural networks. The long term goals are to implement a Multilayer perceptron by the summer of 2023, and a Transformer by end of the year.

## Running tests

Taking inspiration from [micrograd's tests](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd/blob/master/test/test_engine.py), we will use [PyTorch's C++ frontend](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/frontend.html) for high level sanity checks using GoogleTest.

To run the tests use:

```sh
sh test.sh
```

Running the tests requires: `cmake`, `make`, `torch` installed (on the version of Python accessed by the `python` command), `git`, and a C++ compiler. Note that these requirements are only for when you need to run the tests, otherwise except the C++ compiler they are not needed.

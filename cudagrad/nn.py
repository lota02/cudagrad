# So the magic is that there's this relatively simple algorithm called
# backpropagation that takes the error in the output and sends that
# error backwards through the network and computes through all the
# connections how you should change them to improve the behavior, and
# then you change them all a tiny bit and you just keep going with
# another example. And surprisingly that actually works. For many years
# people thought that would just get jammed up — it would get stuck
# somewhere — but no it doesn't, it actually works very well.
